# BigBrother
Allows the connection of Minecraft: PC clients to PocketMine-MP servers. Made for PocketMine-MP

###Changelog: Update 3:
* Change the Source to shoghicp and rewrite the previous changes.
* Back again to protocol 1.8 (but is giving the same results in 1.10.0)
* I've set a fixed user (Hello) until the plugin works properly again (Remember to change the user to test it)
* Current issue, user logged in and kicked out for being in a different world.

##Any help to make this plugin working again, will be appreciated.
